This code is originally from a Meteor Photo Blog tutorial Pt.1 which the link is provided below:

However, I'm adding a feature where users could upload sounds to their s3 bucket. However, I came across a problem
and I don't know how to fix it which is why I have put this code up on here.

If anyone could help me you will get credit by having your name as one of the technical supporters of the app.
(If you want your name to be on it)
